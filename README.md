Working with the Netflix Shows dataset presented a few challenges during the data import and analysis process. One of the main difficulties was handling missing values, especially in columns crucial for analysis. This required careful consideration of data imputation techniques or exclusion of incomplete records to maintain data integrity. Additionally, ensuring consistency in data types and formats across columns was another aspect that required attention to avoid issues during querying and visualization tasks.
One fascinating aspect observed in the dataset was the diversity of genres and categories represented in Netflix shows. From classic genres like drama and comedy to niche categories like stand-up comedy, reality TV, and documentaries, the dataset reflects the wide range of content available on the platform. This diversity not only showcases Netflix's extensive content library but also highlights the evolving preferences and interests of viewers worldwide.
